<p>Last Friday, Guildford-based band &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Pattern</em>&nbsp;&#8211;
played at the Face Bar in Reading, an alternative music venue loved by locals
for its intimate space and display of new talent. The band played some of their
singles including: ‘Can’t Sleep’, ‘L.A.T’ and ‘What You Do’, with the crowd
enjoying their chilled and groovy vibe. With influences including icons such as
Radiohead and Tom Misch, the band have created a sound that mixes rock, funk
and pop with heavenly guitar solos and choruses that will resonate in your head
for days on end. When asked how they would describe their sound, the band
answered: “We wouldn’t really stick one genre onto our band. We mainly just
like to write music that we think sounds cool, whether it be in a similar genre
to the last song or something completely different.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The band,&nbsp;made up of singer Louis Whitley; guitarists
Will Jones and George Fleming; bassist Jack Taylor and Max Colley on drums are
all students from ACM in Guildford where they met and started playing together
last year. With three songs already on Spotify and another due to come out any
day now, the band are well on their way to being successful. Whilst discussing
the song writing process, the band said; ‘Usually Will or Jack would start with
a cool melody or bass line, and then Max would create a drum groove that works
well with it. We usually experiment a lot.’ Coming up with original and
meaningful lyrics can often be the most problematic part of writing music,
which Pattern confirm; “Making different sections of songs and making sure the
previous section works with the new section is the biggest challenge. But
sometimes we just jam&nbsp;together&nbsp;and a cool idea or song will just come out
of no-where.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their short time together, they have become a
real presence in the local music scene, with their talent recognised by BBC
Introducing and played on BBC Radio Surrey. They have played venues like
The&nbsp;Boileroom&nbsp;supporting Australian band: Planet, The
Acoustic Lounge in Bracknell, The Basement in Kingston and The Star Inn, as
well as The Tunbridge Wells Forum which they will have played at in October to
support punk band Feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure to follow their Instagram: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@patternofficial_  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/patternofficial_/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">@patternofficial_ </span></a>for all things Pattern and upcoming gigs.</p>

<p>Every night out has its morning after, and for every morning
after there’s a song to perk you up.</p>



<p>It’s that time of year again, and Stag Hill is buzzing. For the freshers among us &#8211; welcome to student life! By the time you read this, you’ll probably have unpacked most of your belongings, hung up your fairy lights and had at least one dubious night out in Rubix. University is a time for new experiences, the vast majority of which are enjoyable and exciting. However, it’s not always a party, here’s five of the less glamorous student moments… and a tune to get you through each.</p>

<p>It’s
awful. It isn’t even that early! But your alarm always comes painfully
prematurely, leaving you unable to contemplate the challenges of operating your
own limbs, let alone doing a degree. You’re not alone – countless students
before you have negotiated this mountain. You need solidarity and a strong
coffee. Whack on the kettle and turn up this 2001 classic. It’ll make you feel
like you’re starring in your own TV show, with cheese power lyrics “the
universe will give me strength like spinach” why not start your day with this <em>poetry</em>?
Its 6:31 running time will spare you enough seconds to fall out of bed and
throw on some clothes… before you start to question everything.</p>

<p>They don’t tell you in freshers’ week, but caffeine after 2am doesn’t actually wake you up, it only exacerbates your fury. Redirect your rage from your significantly more smug and better rested professor, to the task at hand with Monks’ 2019 single. The world is opening quickly for the Liverpool lads, whose latest phaser-soaked epic has earned them some well-deserved attention. Shouty-but-tuneful vocals and a drum line that absolutely slaps are guaranteed to wake you right up. Bonus points if you can make out the hidden sample at the start. Double bonus points if you go see them <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.musicglue.com/monks/tour" target="_blank">live next month</a></span> and triple bonus points if you manage to get your essay done by sunrise. </p>

<p>From
a cooked breakfast to hair of the dog, you’ll hear all sorts of witch-magic
hangover cures over the coming weeks. There’s only one thing that really works,
and that is to sit it out until you feel better. In the meantime, you can find
some respite from the banging in your head with this ultra-chill track from
French producer FKJ. This doesn’t really need any selling – listen to the first
10 seconds and you’ll have a strong urge to crawl back into bed to be soothed
by the melodic beat. You can catch up on that lecture tomorrow.</p>

<p>Who
doesn’t love a post-lunch nap. Sadly, your ever expanding work schedule doesn’t
afford you midday snooze time. BROCKHAMPTON are here to help, with a song
that’s something of a trojan horse – relaxed enough to slip into your sleepy
vibe, before hitting you with a ludicrously catchy chorus and some intriguing
wordplay. Like a benevolent parasite, 1999 WILDFIRE get into your brain and
take you over the early afternoon hurdle.</p>

<p>If you have a penchant for murky potholes of indeterminate depth and sodium orange streetlights, then Guildford can look lovely in the rain. However, for the majority of us, the winter months can be miserable. Walking home in the drizzle and the dark is a mood! But find the right music to indulge these moments, and a exhausted, damp stroll can be transformed into a cinematic experience. Jordan Rakei’s soulful voice blends perfectly with haunting synthesiser glissandi, pleasing low-fi beats and the subtlest of guitar solos from Tom Misch to create a song ready-made for the A3 subway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>Returning from a stay in Liverpool had me itching to check
out Guildford’s music scene, and so I headed to watch the latest episode of GT
Live Sessions. Hosted at the
Britannia, this weekly event is a showcase of local talent organised by
guitarist and songwriter Gavin Thomas.</p>



<p>First on the bill
were Lauren and Hardy, an acoustic guitar and vocal duo whose seamless on-stage
chemistry made for some incredibly exciting playing. Intoxicating steel-stringed
melodies wove together, providing an ideal base for impressive vocal play
between Mason’s airy soprano and Hardy’s gritty bass. The singing was as well
matched as the guitars, and tight harmonies demonstrated the unmistakeable
togetherness that comes from hours of practise and performance. Their groovy,
triplet-feel cover of Survivior was undoubtedly the highlight; my head was
bobbing throughout, and a quick scan of the audience behind me confirmed that I
was not alone.</p>



<p>Next up was Vicky
Sayers, a singer-songwriter who took to the stage armed with acoustic guitar,
microphone, bundles of energy and infectious charm. A driving, strummed
accompaniment and some tidy work on the equaliser from Thomas allowed plenty of
space for Sayers to display her vocal agility. Long, airy verse lines meshed well
with weightier, more soulful choruses to frame a performance driven by raw
songwriting talent; “Human Nature” instantly brought to mind the
powerful-yet-catchy performances of a young KT Tunstall, while “Rolling Stone” would
look right at home in the upper reaches of the UK Top 40.</p>



<p>A short intermission saw the arrival of a kit and Launchpad on stage, much to my excitement. My instincts were right, as what followed was undoubtedly my favourite act of the evening. Solent-born <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BRUCH (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/BruchMusic/" target="_blank"><strong>BRUCH</strong></a>, a student at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM), presented a set genuinely unlike anything I have heard before. With reverb cranked to 11 and phasers set to stun, BRUCH opened with a masterclass in vocal control supported by a dreamy, tumbling backing track. Her performance had the air of a 2009 Florence Welch submerged in a vat of purple synthesiser juice, such was the degree of vocal versatility and width of stereo on display. Suspended, crystalline melodies were interspersed with yelps of joy from the young artist, whose captivating on-stage presence silenced all conversation in the bar. The addition of Ryan Bartlett on drums for “Crown” betrayed a sudden sense of urgency and what was a dreamy, ethereal set instantly became driving, energetic and brimming with anger. Bartlett’s restrained use of floor tom and snare struck an unmistakably war-like tone (think Florence’s “Leave My Body” from Ceremonials, but faster, darker and much, much more pissed off!). </p>



<p>BRUCH considers
nature as one of her main influences and this is plain to see; where the
earlier numbers represented something akin to delicate vines growing around a
great tree trunk, these later numbers brought images of an Atlantic storm
battering the Hampshire coast. This anger is no metaphor, however; I caught up
with BRUCH before the show where she expressed how her frustration and rage at
the mistreatment of the planet is a definite driving force behind her writing.
A truly exciting talent, this is definitely not an act to miss, and with more
releases scheduled for later in the year we can expect big things to come.</p>



<p>From the
awe-inspiring to the delightful, next up was Polly Gone Wrong, a female
voice-only trio who could not hide their wonderful on-stage chemistry; an
infectious, swaggering confidence full of giggly, cheeky energy. At its heart,
creativity is about reaching a playful state of mind and Polly Gone Wrong
embody this perfectly, riffing off each other both in performance and between
songs. A deeply charming stage presence did not go for want of talent, however,
as the trio navigated effortlessly between chromatic close harmonies and
parallel thirds, fifths and octaves, sometimes from bar to bar, interspersed
with occasional beatboxing. Melding top singing talent with thoroughly likeable
personas, Polly Gone Wrong could make even Pachabell’s Canon interesting.</p>



<p>Next on the bill was
Beamis, a two-man guitar and voice lineup from Portsmouth. It is hard to beat
the appeal of two old boys rocking out, and the combination of driving, clean
rhythm and peachy lead sounded like something straight from an Eagles concert.
Accomplished strumming, supplied by some of the more tidy wristwork I’ve seen
recently, knitted seamlessly with the vocals to produce an appealing, enjoyable
sound. Beamis’ frothy, joyful opener reminiscent of the Bellamy Brothers’ glory
days kept smiles on faces, while the darker, more urgent tracks would not have
been out of place in a smoky Nashville dive bar. Overall, a solid set executed
with precision, dexterity and, most importantly, a genuine joie-de-vivre.</p>



<p>The final set saw
local singer-songwriter Tom Copson take the stage. Copson’s appealing brand of
clean acoustic guitar and treacly, glinting baritone are the perfect tools to
showcase an exciting song writing talent. Unfortunately, train timetables
forced me to bid an early and reluctant goodbye to the Britannia, and so I
missed the rest of the set. However, readers can listen to all of Tom’s
releases on Bandcamp, YouTube and Soundcloud.</p>



<p>Each of the acts expressed themselves and their work with skill and confidence. The artists here have exiting futures in store, with both the talent and potential to achieve notoriety. Music is happening in Guildford, and it is happening right now – you won’t want to miss it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>It’s no secret that students love music
festivals. As an escape from the day-to-day humdrum of studying and part-time
jobs, most of us for one weekend a year get to put on a ludicrous outfit,
complete with body paint and glitter and become obnoxiously drunk whilst
partying to some of the sounds of the summer. However, with this fun comes a
great deal of organisational turmoil. Primarily, how on earth do you choose
which festival to go to? Well look no further. We have taken some of the best
festivals across the European continent and placed them right here for your
perusal. So whether you’re looking for a full weekend campout, a small city
groovefest or an electronic rave-a-geddon, read on for your full festival guide
for 2020.</p>



<p><strong>1. Glastonbury</strong><em> (Pilton, England)</em></p>



<p>Let’s get this one out of the way. The name
synonymous with the term “Music Festival” around the world of course makes an
appearance on this list. Starting in 1970, when it was originally called <em>“Pilton Festival”</em>, <em>Glastonbury</em> celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2020, making it one
of the most hotly anticipated festival tickets in history. </p>



<p><em>Glastonbury
</em>is more than just a music festival. Ask anyone you
know who’s been to the festival and I can guarantee that each one of them had a
totally different experience. It is a celebration of all that is art and
culture, from political rallies to druid circles, from underground piano bars
to all night hallucinogenic rave-fests, there is literally something for
everyone at <em>Glastonbury</em>. Not to
mention boasting some of the largest headliners in music history, accompanied
by the infamous “Legends” slot, where the most prolific stars of yester-year
make exclusive performances for the thousands and thousands of adoring fans. A
must-attend for any music fan.&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong>2. Francofolies</strong> <em>(La Rochelle, France)</em></p>



<p>From probably the most well-known festival on
this list to by far the most obscure, <em>Francofolies</em>,
or to give it its official title <em>“Les
Francofolies de La Rochelle”</em>, is a relatively small music festival in La
Rochelle, France. Founded in 1985, this festival is focussed on highlighting
the best that francophonic music has to offer. </p>



<p>Mainly focussed around one stage, the
festival is set alongside the gorgeous port of La Rochelle, easily one of the
most spectacular festival locations you will come across. Whilst it may lack
the hard-hitting heavyweight headliners of some of the other festivals here, it
does inspire some of the greatest performances from its French artistes, with
previous showstoppers including Christine and the Queens, Mika, DJ Snake,
Stromae, Woodkid and Caravan Palace. For the fan of more obscure musical genres
(we’re looking at you electro-swing) and smaller-scale festivals, you can’t go
wrong with this hidden gem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong><em>3. Primavera Sound</em></strong><em> (Barcelona, Spain)</em></p>



<p>When discussing beautiful locations to house
a music festival, it is impossible to ignore <em>Primavera Sound</em>. One of the most popular music festivals on
mainland Europe, it is set on the beautiful coast of Barcelona, with one side
of the entire festival site flanked by the Mediterranean Sea. Although location
is not all this fantastic festival has to offer.</p>



<p>Founded in 2001, <em>Primavera </em>has focussed on representing the entire musical landscape
within one festival, effortlessly combining legends with established careers
with up-and-coming artists, the biggest names of international music with
outstanding domestic Spanish and Catalan talent. But most importantly, in 2019
came the “New Normal” initiative, as <em>Primavera
Sound </em>laid down the gauntlet for all major music festivals around the
world, by announcing a 50/50 split gender-equal lineup, showcasing some of the
greatest female talent from around the world. A utopian home for all, <em>Primavera </em>highlights that which makes us
all unique, whilst providing a sense of community and safety for every member,
and 2020 is only going to be bigger and better.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong><em>4. Melt! Festival</em></strong> <em>(Gräfenhainichen, Germany)</em></p>



<p>The second relatively obscure addition to the
lineup is <em>Melt! Festival</em>. Located in
the “Ferropolis” or “City of Iron” in Gräfenhainichen (no don’t ask us to
pronounce it), it is an electronic music festival located in an open-air museum
of giant metal machinery. Whilst laser-shows on abandoned oil-rigs may not be
everyone’s cup of tea, for those who can’t resist the lure of thumping drum and
bass and pulsing EDM, this is a bucket-list event. </p>



<p>Throughout its 22 year history, <em>Melt!</em> has played host to some of the
largest names in, not only electronica, but also alternative, indie, and pop
music, including; Alt-J, Kylie Minogue, Oasis, Franz Ferdinand, Pulp, Bloc
Party, and Robyn, to name but a few. Like many other festivals, it has also
taken a fiercely strong stance on sustainability, offering tent recycling schemes
for those who don’t want to keep their mud-covered portable home, however its
truly spectacular facade is where this unique festival sets itself apart from
the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong><em>5. Rock Werchter</em></strong><em> (Werchter, Belgium)</em></p>



<p>Another long-running member of the festival
scene, <em>Rock Werchter</em> first graced
Belgium with its presence in 1976. Until the 1990s it mainly attracted a
domestic audience, despite the incredible international talent on display,
however exploded into popularity around the turn of the millennium, and since
2003, the first year it became a four day festival officially named <em>“Rock Werchter”</em>, has won the <em>“Best Festival in the World”</em> award a
whopping six times.</p>



<p>When reading through the list of acts to have
conquered <em>Rock Werchter</em>, it almost
reads as a “who’s who” of musical history. Since the 1980s the small Belgian
town has played host to absolute titans of music, from U2, Aerosmith, Pink
Floyd, David Bowie and Bob Dylan to Arctic Monkeys, Muse, Coldplay, Arcade Fire
and Kasabian. It’s honestly harder to think of a festival-headlining
chart-topping artist who hasn’t played Werchter than to name all of the ones
who have. Despite all of this, tickets are incredibly limited, with less than
70,000 full festival tickets available, so make sure to get them early if you
fancy this Belgian blockbuster.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong><em>6. Roskilde Festival</em></strong> <em>(Roskilde, Denmark)</em></p>



<p>Once a year the fairly quiet city of Roskilde
in Denmark plays host to the largest festival in Northern Europe. Comparable in
size, and price, to Glastonbury, <em>Roskilde
Festival</em> totally takes over the Danish city in an explosion of sound and
colour. Another festival that attracts the largest names on the rock, pop, and
rap scenes (with previous headliners including The Rolling Stones, Prince, and
Eminem), <em>Roskilde</em> offers a little bit
of everything to the thousands of fans who make the journey.</p>



<p>What’s most impressive about this festival is
how wholeheartedly it acts as a support mechanism for charitable organisations
the world over. The festival opened in 1971 thanks to the organisation of two
students, and the Roskilde foundation took over in 1972. Since then it has been
run as a non-profit organization that supports cultural, humanitarian and other
non-profit organisations around the world, meaning that not only do you get to
see an awesome festival, but you get to feel good about supporting great causes
at the same time. Oh and also there’s a naked run around the campsite every
year with the chance to win a free ticket to the following year’s festival, if
you’re into that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong>7. Sziget Festival</strong> <em>(Budapest, Hungary)</em></p>



<p>One of the youngest festivals on the list,
founded in 1993, <em>Sziget Festival</em> also
happens to be, by a very significant margin, the largest. In 2018, <em>Sziget </em>welcomed approximately 565,000
visitors onto its island (for comparison, <em>Glastonbury</em>
2019 welcomed roughly 200,000). In fairness, it does have the advantage of
being a week-long festival, but still those numbers are astronomical. </p>



<p>Located on an island floating on the Danube
in the center of Budapest, the festival originated as a student-run event, but
rapidly became increasingly popular, and now is one of the most popular
festivals in Europe. Including a plethora of alternative activities aside from
its incredible musical lineup (the headliners this year alone include Ed
Sheeran, Foo Fighters, Florence + The Machine and The 1975), there is even a
“party train” service, with designated DJs, that brings travellers from all
across Europe to the festival site. </p>



<p>Hopefully you’ve found your perfect niche in one of these festivals, and can now get on with planning for your summer vibes of 2020, but if you haven’t, then fear not. With a little bit of research you’ll soon discover the vast array of festivals that are, for now at least, right on your doorstep. So rock on my fellow music lovers. Rock on.</p>

<p><strong>MJ SoFly</strong> is a creative, experimental and masterful 20-year-old rapper from West London whose sound is reminiscent of nostalgic hip-hop music. The up-and-coming artist has been surrounded by music his entire life. His first interactions with music were through his Dad who is a former DJ, so in this way musical talent and creativity is instilled within him. For this SUBCULTURED issue, Mirfat Khamis caught up with the ‘Fly’ guy to discuss all things music, inspiration and how he balances his studies whilst making and releasing music. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>What do you
enjoy the most about making music?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>What I enjoy most about making music is being in the studio with me and my people making music. What makes the experience even more enjoyable would be the feeling of going to the studio not knowing what I’m going to make and leaving the studio with one or more songs.</em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>How would you
describe your sound and what genre does your music fall into?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>I wouldn’t say I have a particular type of sound just yet but what I will say is that my sound definitely stems from hip-hop. I personally feel like I don’t fit into any one genre because my versatility allows me to sway across a number of different genres. </em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What was the
inspiration behind your artist name?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>The MJ part of my artist name is something that people have always called me growing up. The SoFly part of my name is part of the record label that I co-founded with my friends. It is a music, management and visual arts collective movement. </em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Who are you
inspired by?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>I am inspired by artists such as The Notorious B.I.G, Snoop Dogg and Donell Jones as I have grown up listening to their music. To some extent this is where my inspiration of music comes from but not entirely. This is because part of what inspires me is music itself like instruments used and the beats and percussions.</em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Have you ever
dealt with performance anxiety?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>Not really. I always can’t wait to get on stage. I always experience a good nervous feeling. I just want to get on the stage and when the show is done, I just want to be back on again performing doing what I love – sharing my music and telling my story through it.</em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>When can we
expect new music? / What’s next for you?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>Me and SoFly are expecting to release music within the next couple of months, hopefully during the Summer. There is a SoFly tape due to come out, so watch out for that one. Admittedly we haven’t released a lot of music recently because we have been working hard in the studio producing and making tracks as we are working on perfecting our craft in terms of our delivery, flow, lyrics and the beats. Personally, I don’t want to rush the music process, so I am looking forward to sharing musical content that is much more advanced than the music we have released previously.</em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What do you
feel is the best song you’ve released and why?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>I don’t think I’ve released a song of my highest potential just yet. I think my best songs are still unreleased. But if I could name one song, I’ve released I’d say life at 2am with my friend Primo. I think that’s my best song so far because it is a relevant reflection of the experiences I was facing at the time. This was the first song I’ve done where the beat was different to what I would usually rap to. Also, it is the first song where I expressed heartfelt lyrics. So yeah that song is most certainly close to the heart.</em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>If you could choose
to collaborate with one artist from the U.K and U.S who would it be and why?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>Okay. From the U.K I
would choose to work with IAMDDB because she brings her own wave and is in her
own lane when it comes to the music which makes her work very original and
authentic. Her sound is something that can’t be replicated. And I feel as
though she is one of a kind in the U.K especially because there aren’t many
original old school and new school artists that can do it like her. So, I think
if we would ever get in the studio together, we would make real good music.</em></p>



<p><em>And from the U.S it would have to be Nipsey Hussle who is one of my all-time favorite rappers, especially of this generation because not a lot of artists can rap about real life the way that he does. Nipsey is always telling a message and a story in his music. You can tell that he is a real musician based on his flow, delivery, voice and the instruments he chooses to use. And yeah, he’s woke! I just consider him one of the greats.</em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>When did you realise you had such a passion
for music?</strong></p>



<p><em>A year and a half ago I really realised my passion for music when me and my friend went into the studio to make music and a year and a half later, we’re still here! My passion also comes from the fact that I grew up around music. My Dad was a DJ in his days so music was constantly around me. He would always be teaching me about music, quizzing be about who produced songs and I’d just have to try and guess. So, making music was never something that was completely out of my reach because it was already implanted deep within me.</em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What makes
your music unique?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>I would say my music is unique because it is a very different sound to the U.K music scene. And even though I am trying to make a break through into the U.K music scene, I am bringing a very old-school American sort of vibe. The music in the U.K is in need of something new and that’s something that I am offering because no other artist in the U.K is jumping on beats like mine or has a flow like mine, I’m in my own lane. Not only this but I feel as though every verse, every hook, every chorus that I write has a meaningful message behind it. If I’m not telling a story then you might learn something about me in my music. Which is why my music is so different, because most rappers in the music scene aren’t sending messages through their music anymore. </em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What is your favorite
song that isn’t yours?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><em>My favorite song right now is “Brown Hair” by Jay Critch because like me he is also in his own lane, doing his own thing, with his own sound and own style. Even the energy he brings into his songs is completely different to a lot of songs out there right now.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>For music lovers, music is a reflection of feelings. I’m no
different – when I’m stressed, I listen to music. When I’m sad, I listen to
music. When I’m happy, I listen to music. Listening to music is what keeps
people going when they feel like they can’t go on anymore. It transports you to
another place, one where you don’t have the same worries and anxieties that you
thought you had five minutes ago. Music has so much power, across all
generations, all races, all genders. I love the power it has. It brings people
of all walks of life together. It only makes sense that music is a symphony of
many emotions, as it is an expression of an artist’s feelings. Once hidden
away, to be brought to life in song, just for a moment. Emotions shared evoke
emotions in others and so the butterfly effect unfolds in front of your very
eyes. Watching someone feel moved by a piece of music is something that cannot
be compared to anything else. Bringing some to tears and you can’t explain why.
This and more, is all what has inspired many to sing and express their love for
music and Cordeliya Prahalathan is no exception.<br>
<strong><br>
So, Cordeliya, why don’t you introduce yourself to SUBCULTURED?<br>
</strong>“So, I am a second year psychology student… An ordinary girl, living an
ordinary life. Music has been part of my journey from a very young age and has
got me through a lot of difficult times in my life.”</p>



<p><strong>How long have you have
singing?<br>
</strong>“I learnt Carnatic music when I was little, with the veena alongside that.
I’m at grade 8 with Carnatic, basically diploma level, and with the veena I am
at grade 7. Being able to share my passion with other people is such a blessing
– it’s super nice.”<strong><br>
<br>
What’s your favourite memory that singing has given you?<br>
</strong>“Being a shy person, performing alone is very nerve-wracking for me so my
performance last year at the University of Surrey’s iGala was a challenge. But
it was also a fear to overcome, having everyone look at me whilst I sang a
solo. On the day of the performance I was absolutely terrified, but my friends
encouraged me. As soon as I got on that stage with the spotlights on me, I was
transported to another place. That was my moment. Hearing people cheering you
on gives you the boost you need and reminds you why you love music so much. It
makes you feel alive. I realised the power of music in that moment. I was so
happy and proud that I faced my fears, because hearing the audience applaud at
the end was such an unbelievable feeling that I will remember for the rest of
my life.”<strong><br>
<br>
How do you balance your passion with student life, especially as you’re a
second year student?<br>
</strong>“Due to my studies, I had to take a break for a while because it was a bit
much at the time. But I haven’t given up on my passion, last year I saw the
opportunity to perform for the university’s Tamil society and I thought “why
not!””<strong><br>
<br>
Is this something you’d like to continue throughout your life?<br>
</strong>“I don’t think music will ever not be a part of my life. Now that I’m in
second year, my friends suggested that I should start a cover account on
Instagram to showcase my singing. Hopefully to lead on to a YouTube account
later down the line. Originally I didn’t want to because I was overthinking the
negatives, but once I realised they were stopping me from pursuing what I
actually wanted to do, I went for it. Uploading my first cover was so scary,
but the support I got was really encouraging and it really inspired me to keep
going, so I’m excited to see where it takes me!”</p>



<p><em>Interested to hear more?<br> Please follow her on Instagram at </em><strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" @cordeliyamusic (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/cordeliyamusic/" target="_blank">@cordeliyamusic</a></em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>In 1978, a 19 year-old Kate Bush made history by becoming the first female to get a #1 in theUK with a self-written song titled ‘Wuthering Heights’. Forty years later, she’s self-produced with her own record label ‘Fish People’ and ten albums to her name. On the 16<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> November, she will be releasing her entire remastered discography on CD and Vinyl. But what is it about Kate Bush that has continued to make her a treasured figure in music?</p>

<p>Not only did she begin to make her mark at such a young age, she did it on her own terms. Her approach to music is a lot more experimental in comparison to her contemporaries such as Blondie or Madonna. Labelled as ‘the Queen of art pop<a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>’, an eclectic range of sounds can be found within her discography such as classical, renaissance, glam rock and reggae to name a few. Several of her albums contain a heavy use of a CMI synthesizer that allows her to manipulate sounds in her music such as broken glass or gun cocks. Since it first appeared in her 1980 album ‘Never for ever’, it became a prominent tool in the production of her future albums. With Bush describing it as an ‘atmospheric tool<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>’, it allows her to further delve into creativity and the avant-garde. However, this is a complete contrast to the piano led ‘Lionheart’ or the rock influences found in ‘The Red Shoes.’ With all of her musical projects, she seamlessly blends various sounds and genres to create an alluring accompaniment to her lyrics. </p>



<p>Bush is very much a storyteller when it comes to writing her lyrics. Her main influences come from multiple aspects of culture whether that be historical, cinematic or found in literature. However, her work that truly stands out is the powerful narratives that she creates herself. For example, ‘Breathing’ is from the viewpoint of a foetus during nuclear war and in ‘And dream of sheep’ she introduces a woman lost at sea. With each of her songs, she creates a character and embodies them entirely to tell the listener their story. Through her emphasis of the powerful yet gentle tones of her voice, she effectively dramatizes her characters. Whether that be a mother, a bank robber or a soldier, her stories continue to be compelling and leave the listener captivated.</p>

<p>Her artistry does not only lie within her music. To accompany her music, she creates magnificent and visually stunning music videos that continue to carry on her stories. In 1993, she released her own musical film ‘The line, the cross and the curve’ for her album ‘The Red Shoes.’ The film was nominated fora Grammy Award and is still played in art house cinemas to this day. Bush is also trained in mime and has taken dance lessons by esteemed choreographer,Lindsay Kemp. With these skills she is able to communicate to her audience through motion and her facial expressions as well as her lyrics, showing herself to be a dynamic artist. In ‘Running up that hill’, the relationship between the man and woman is revealed through how they respond to each other’s actions and the closeness they maintain and repel. With her movement, she gains control leaving everyone else to watch and admire&nbsp; her.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s incredibly rare for Kate Bush to make a public appearance these days. Her 22-date residency at Hammersmith Apollo in 2014 was her first live performance in 35 years. Her choice to remove herself directly from the spotlight allows her to focus entirely on her creative process. Through this isolation, she inadvertently presents herself as a mystical enigmatic figure, and eagerly we watch and wait for what she comes up with next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"></p>
<p class="normal">Music is an outlet for expression. That was most definitely seen at BBC Music Introducing LIVE last week. So much culture and colour in one setting, designed to inspire all those who attended. Musicians and instrumentalists alike, the atmosphere was buzzing with people of all ages making connections and gaining inside knowledge on the music industry. As R&amp;B artist Call Me Unique was performing her charismatic set on the North Bandstand, James McVinnie and Belle Chen were sharing their creative insights on how classical music can have influence on the contemporary pop sound we hear on our radio stations every day.</p>
<p class="normal">Elizabeth Alker of BBC 6Music and BBC Radio 3 opened the discussion up in ‘Unclassified… Taking Influence From Classical &amp; Pop’ of how to introduce audiences to new music. Breakfast radio show ‘Unclassified’ has had a good response with audiences, reflecting influences from pop, rock, jazz and electronic music genres. Unique, albeit eclectic, artists such as Thomas Bartlett &amp; Nico Muhly, as well as Bryce Dessner and Aphex Twin, were all played to showcase the growing movement of different genres across a broad range of artists. Australian pianist Belle Chen trained at the Royal Academy and has a new album ‘Departure’ out now. Her third full-length album draws inspiration from traditional sounds from all around the world. Over the course of the talk, she voiced her passion for wanting to tell her own story and this is what drove her to start creating her own sound. A lot of her inspiration comes from experimenting with acoustic instruments in order to make music that draws from the world around her.</p>
<p>English organist James McVinnie’s innovated new angles on pipe organs and how they can be assimilated to early synthesisers when describing his new album ‘The Grid’. Initially, McVinnie expressed how traditional instruments such as the pipe organ can have a lot of preconceived ideas attached to them, but when remodelled and brought to life in a different way, can be uniquely received by an audience. Genre-hopping has been around for as long as music has, and every artist has to start somewhere with the type of music they draw upon in order to create their own musical identity. This is key to understanding the stance that both Chen and McVinnie take in their music, starting a dialogue that begs the question: should the term “unclassified” be a genre in itself?</p>

<p class="normal">On the other side of the Tobacco Docks, Clean Bandit’s Jack Patterson broke down his song ‘Solo’ in a masterclass open to all that were interested in the technical mixing process. He too, spoke of his classical roots. After all, Grace Chatto and himself started off by recording Chatto’s string quartet performances in Cambridge before Luke Patterson joined the band. In experimenting with different sound samples, they very quickly attracted attention and haven’t turned back since. As a band, they pride themselves in using original samples and mixing their songs independently, but Patterson was open in admitting that sometimes the biggest challenge in song-writing is to know when to let go of a demo and let it develop further before it can be heard by the public. Towards the end of the masterclass, he revealed his intent for the future sound of Clean Bandit, wanting to get back to their classical roots even though that can sometimes bring more musical challenges. With his jazz background, he expressed a love for mixing classical and electronic sounds, which ultimately creates Clean Bandit’s signature sound.</p>
<p class="normal"><a name="_gjdgxs"></a>Looking ahead to the future of the industry, BBC Music Introducing LIVE perfectly showed how music genres have evolved over time. Even today, electronic, dance and house artists are still looking back to previous models of music, proving its true immortality. SUBCULTURED left Tobacco Docks feeling inspired and excited for up and coming music artists who established more of a name for themselves. A hub for dynamic and bright individuals, music has lived on in society for generations with its unparalleled nature to connect individuals from all walks of life. We wonder, what will we hear on the radio next?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">I started playing SHADED’s “Dream Girl” at full volume in an isolated study space tucked away in my departmental building one night, just to hear it, and – after quickly hitting pause and turning down the volume upon the initial eardrum quake – thought ‘man, I really like this’. Then I thought that the vocals needed better equalisation, which for the average listener just means that despite being pretty loud you might feel like you’re straining to hear the voice over the music. Thankfully, this doesn’t persist through the whole track, and is a non-starter in the rest of the songs.</p>
<p>And when you can hear the vocals, you pick out something not often seen in this soft-punk-pop since Avril skated away: the singer really cares about vocal quality and technique, and isn’t afraid to show off in ways your average neon pink emo ‘00s tween would think were just not <em>cool </em>compared to the generic shout-singing that made us all think we could start a band. I had to hit pause again at the first “but you’re not the one that I need girl”, as clichéd as the lyric is, to just appreciate this. Because if 2018 can’t bring about a real embracing of musical skill no matter the fragile semantics of genre, what can?</p>
<p>The vocal excellence shatters a bit when it veers into common practice (with a bit of a country tone? Though you can’t go wrong with mid-transition Taylor Swift as inspiration) and then into repetition. We can’t condemn songs for repeating lyrics in the appropriate places, but vocal variety is something you have to afford if you don’t want me to feel like only one take was good enough and you Ctrl+P’d it for every chorus. Saying this, the bridge smashes vocal complexity, so the three lines of slipping into boring territory can be ploughed through.</p>

<p>“Dream Girl”? I’d listen to that at the gym, on a walk, studying. It’s good, and it works, and you can forgive it those minor grievances because it’s an unguilty pleasure.</p>
<p>The title track (“A Familiar Love”) suffers a bit more: a long intro shortly followed by an early bridge is confusing, and the music definitely rules in this particular song – which would be fine if not for the fact that it is, for the most part, barely distinguishable from the previous song (“Dream Girl”). Back-to-back, this creates a postmodern listening experience where there’s a slight mood shift but it feels like an extension of the same song, or a deliberate interval between tracks. It doesn’t get to two minutes before it feels like the song should have ended, and it might not be enticing enough to keep people listening past this point when it plays on shuffle, which is a little bit tragic because after this is when the variety and technical ability (shout out to the guitarist) finally shifts into fifth gear. It’s worth listening to, because it’s not missing anything it needs, though it feels a bit wobbly, so I wouldn’t isolate it as individually powerful. And why is the fade out so long?</p>
<p>Contrastingly, the final track “You” is a firecracker of a song that sounds like it was written for a film soundtrack. Possibly for the ending credits, but also potentially during some dramatic rom-com airport chase scene. Now, again, let’s not overly-concern ourselves with the words, instead focusing our attentions on the nice scaling of the musical scale done for some of these notes. I don’t think you need more of me saying that it’s musically good, but you need to know that the progression is very well done – songwriting is more than just music, and they’ve mastered the structure here, too.</p>
<p>As a short slide away from compliments, I have to tell you that my first impression of “Tell Me” is that it, without lyrics, is perfect as an alternative music track for “Party in the USA” until 35 seconds, and then for Miley’s <em>actual </em>pop-punk dabble of “7 Things” after that and, seriously, why make me think about Hannah Montana releasing an emo EP? But you know what, I’ll go back and restart it once I’ve cleansed that from my mind.</p>
<p>Hey, this is a really good song. It doesn’t hit stride till around the minute mark, but if you listen to the voice as well then it segues from Miley into something that I can’t think of a suitable comparison for. <em>Let’s call it SHADED.</em>Their sound is well-defined in this track, and I will now, for you, define that sound as a wonderful complement between the singer’s vocal abilities – constantly at a soft shout and having the occasional quarrel with the confines of range, to his advantage – and the tuneful bashing by crowbars of every instrument they could find in his garage that constitutes the music. That guitarist also comes out to shine again, so the next song best have a solo in it <em>à la </em>Queen. Ironically, “tell me I’m fine for the hundredth time” is also the thing I say most often in relationships.</p>
<p>That’s a lie, I just can’t date. Which gives me the time to have enough of a musical variety stored in my noggin to know that the intro and opening chords of “Dead Feelings” were both sampled, I just can’t remember what songs from. The whole song, following suit, feels like the bastard child of songs from different branches of the genre of rock. It’s like an All-American Rejects angry ‘I got just dumped’ song and a Say Anything sad ‘I just got dumped’ song were shoved into a blender and the result was discarded on the countertop – which, in genuine retrospect, is a process that would make me feel angry, sad, and dumped, so I guess that works.</p>

<p>Realistically, the EP is a pretty basic dive from the springboard of pop-punk, and its cheesy uninspired lyrics aren’t much to get excited about, but even from half a song you can tell that SHADED has talent. It’s like no band has really had the courage to tiptoe towards the pool since about 2011, and these guys have not only tried, they’ve definitely succeeded. It was simple, but they didn’t splash everyone, and after years of nothing I’m personally into this approach to a revival. So they’re not hitting Blink or Paramore’s records, but with execution marks like that, a bit more experience will see them onto the scoreboard. They’re musically gifted instrumentally and vocally, and not so punk that they’re going to scare away your little sister; I really hope for more music from SHADED. And this EP? Send it to the ex you’re pissed off at.</p>
