<p>The day has finally come, SUBCULTURED is coming to an end. Whether it’s a temporary hiatus or something permanent (only time will tell), I felt like it was time to move on. With everything that has happened this year, I could not foresee us trying to recruit a new team of staff amidst COVID-19, to replace those who have graduated. But it has been an incredible journey.</p>



<p>It all started in 2015 with a strong, gut feeling that wouldn’t go away, causing me to send an email to the student body about this idea that would quite frankly, change my life! Hundreds of responses to my email and subsequently calls, meetings and discussions led to our website launch and first issue in Semester 2 of 2016. Little did I know when I sent that email how much SUBCULTURED would impact my life and all those involved. It was a key factor in obtaining my placement year, the subject of university assignments, a source of like-minded people and so much more! To this day, I have still referenced it in post-grad interviews and it has been a vessel to get me where I am today. And it has done the same for many others as well. I have also learnt sooo much about entrepreneurship, work-life balance, people management, and pretty much every single creative skill going <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I’m not going to lie though, there were both ups and downs (as is everything in life) to running the magazine, but it has made me who I am today and I wouldn’t change it for the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I cannot reference just one specific memory, but between the years of 2015 and 2018, where I was most involved, was a key time in the magazine, which included our website launch and party in 2016, the University of Surrey hoodies shoot (one of my favourite photo-shoots to date), doing our first print issue in 2018 and the Black Students of British Institutions feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to give a huge shout out to the rest of the team, as without them none of this would have been possible. Thank you to Alice, who has supported myself and the magazine from the very start, partner in crime and a true OG. Thank you to Juliey, for being the force behind our digital presence, thank you to Natalie for coordinating our lit photo-shoots, thank you to Alim for standing in as President of the society after I graduated, thank you to Roshni for shooting some sick street style, thank you to Eve for commissioning articles and putting together a lit final issue and thank you to Daisy for coordinating our last round of content. And thank you to the rest of the current team &#8211; Niki, Amy and Clarise. Some other staff that have since left the magazine but were heavily involved in the launch are Katherine, Zehra, Setareh, Dagmar and Elpida &#8211; thank you! And most of all, thank you to our readers and contributors.</p>



<p>I started off as Editor-in-Chief and Creative Director, being involved in all areas of the magazine, but more recently specialised in the Creative Direction side, leading me to work as a Graphic Designer after graduating. Much self-discovery then led me to Front-End Development within the fashion, media and lifestyle space and I will be starting a new role as a Junior Front-End Developer this month. I am so excited to move on to the next phase of my life but I will miss running this wonderful enterprise.</p>



<p><strong>To conclude, I have created and designed a brand new website for The Farewell Issue, which summarises our best content from the last few years.

<p>Sorry, boomers – but given that it will be the younger
generations who will bear the brunt of a post-Brexit Britain shouldn’t we be
listening to them?</p>



<p>Three years have passed since the 2016 referendum, and Britain is more divided than ever. MPs remain locked in a bitter stalemate over negotiations with the EU, the rift between Brexiteers and Remainers continues to widen and a General Election looms over Christmas.</p>

<p>The uncertainty, party politics and farcical four Brexit extensions could be comical, if it weren&#8217;t responsible for generating great instability at every level of society. Among all the chaos, confusion and the bumping of heads between UK and EU officials, it feels like many voices have been drowned out.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we need a Brexit that does not disenfranchise the British public, and with little to no transparency given on key issues, many feel left in the dark. But more importantly, it is often the concerns of young people that are disregarded. As the inheritors of a post-Brexit Britain, it will fall to the younger generations to deal with the countless list of consequences, felt across the economy, public services, job market, legal system and so on.&nbsp; So, one cannot help but wonder why young people seem to be excluded from public and political discourse?</p>

<p>We asked Surrey students to share their opinions and
concerns regarding Britain’s upcoming split from the EU. </p>



<p>Emma, a final-year Biomedical Sciences student, said the
“whole Brexit ordeal” has just felt like a “living nightmare”. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>“I disagree with the way Brexit has been handled and how drawn out the process has become. It’s just made me lose faith in British politics … Solid plans and foundations should have been put in place before the vote […] rather than just leaving the public in the dark. I feel like we have no say in anything anymore. I had to stop watching the news, after a while it became depressing”.</em></p>

<p>Young people are feeling more disillusioned than ever. In
September 2018, a report carried out by UK in a Changing Europe found that
“more than half of participants felt that they felt their views are not being
listened to”, with a further 90% of participants felt that the government “will
not be able to deliver a Brexit that will work for future generations”. </p>



<p>&nbsp;A popular sentiment felt predominately by the young, many who were too young to vote, or have only recently become engaged with politics, is that any democracy worth its salt is allowed to change its mind, especially on an issue as extensive and as complex as Brexit &#8211; or at the very least, we should have the opportunity to make a more informed decision and vote again.</p>

<p>What’s more, Brexit is actually damaging to our mental health. A Britain Thinks poll released earlier this year found that 83% of those surveyed were sick of hearing about Brexit, while 64% thought it was damaging their mental health. When asked to describe Brexit, the poll noted a clear deterioration in public opinion: in 2017, it was words such as “confusing” or “uncertain”; now, it is “broken” and “chaos”.</p>



<p>Conor, a second-year Surrey student, had this to say:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>“I think it has worsened divides between people – the left and the right, older and younger generations. Overnight two identities were formed, and you had to pick a side. I think it’s created a real rift between people, and the referendum really opened my eyes to how much tension was brewing just under the surface … I don’t see it getting better anytime soon”.</em></p>

<p>In a time of political stability and uncertainty such as this, it is important to open up dialogue and to come to mutual agreements which are compassionate, humanistic and achievable. Brexit, by nature, is a polarizing subject, but we are not seeing any steps being made to bridge the gap between groups: discourse is often heated and inflammatory, and people are growing tired of headline after headline which look to fearmonger or bewilder.</p>



<p><strong><em>“Relationships within and between political parties seem to be strained &#8211; but looking forward what we need right now is cooperation.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Sophia, a final-year student from Germany, spoke to me about her concerns as an EU national living in the UK:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>“I’ve been studying in the UK since I was 16, and I love British people &#8211; but Brexit worries me. Firstly, what will this mean for me staying here? Secondly, will my friends need a<ins> visa </ins>if they want to visit me in Germany? I also feel like the attitudes surrounding immigrants has changed since Brexit. I’m seeing a lot more hate speech around alone, and I’m concerned that Britain could become a lot more xenophobic.”</em></p>

<p>A study by the University of Strathclyde into the
experiences of Eastern European students across England and Wales found that
77% of pupils had suffered racism, xenophobia or bullying, with nearly half
reporting that such behaviour had become more frequent since the referendum. </p>



<p>Many feel that Brexit has somewhat legitimised the xenophobic rhetoric of many right-wing groups, namely UKIP. This was further reinforced by the shift in public discourse surrounding issues such as the EU and immigration.</p>

<p>Practically it seems, regardless of the outcome, Brexit will affect us all. Whilst flights, ferries, trains and any other kind of travel are still guaranteed post-Brexit under international law. It is uncertain what visas may be required and what privileges will be lost; duty free, mobile roaming, health care access, regulations that protect our consumer rights, freedom of movement&#8230;</p>



<p>As for EU citizens, it remains equally uncertain, it may be necessary to take out additional visas and healthcare insurance. Those looking to stay in the UK after 30<sup>th</sup> June 2021 will need to apply before this date to the EU Settlement Scheme get either settled or pre-settled status.</p>

<p>One way or another, Brexit is (probably) happening. This will mean changes, big or small, are on the way. Whilst uncertainty and misinformation sucks&#8230; our best defence against Brexit is making sure we keep ourselves informed and updated, and that we make our voices heard &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="register to vote (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote" target="_blank">register to vote</a></strong></span> if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><em>&#8220;My project is called &#8216;Humans&#8217; and it focuses identity and personality.

<p>Anna – “<em>My mum and dad fight a lot and rarely speak to each other even till this day. One memory ingrained in my brain for many, many years was a time when I was watching a funny TV show with my mum and dad. Someone on TV made a joke and my mum and dad turned to each other and laughed. I&#8217;ve never seen such happy and genuine expressions on their faces, let alone see them look at each other. They didn&#8217;t see me look at them but those were, to me, the most precious 5 seconds &#8211; but also the 5 seconds that I wish I never saw.</em>”</p>

<p>Chin – “<em>Honestly, there hasn’t been a time in my life yet where I truly felt like I lost it all, but there have been moments that I felt lost. My last relationship challenged me and made me question my worth. I saw the signs from the start but refused to confront it. Lol love and infatuation really blind you man. I ended up getting hurt. I’ve always been positive and hopeful no matter how bad situations get but I became the opposite for a while. I only focused on that one ‘bad’ thing and temporarily, well, lost my queen ass self. Then I realised we often forget that how we feel is determined by how we think about ourselves. We are what we repeatedly do. We either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong; the amount of work is the same. I started to appreciate the little things in life that many of us take for granted like the chance to wake up every day to restart. I wanted to be in control of my emotions rather than a person or a situation. I learnt many things along the way like the importance of unconditional love towards family, friends, and especially to the person who cracked my cute lil heart. Love is never wrong. When someone comes into your life who allows you the opportunity to experience love, that’s always a true gift. That romantic love has evolved into a love that encompasses care and compassion for a person who had an important place in my life. That became the main recipe of my healing process. I just wanted to grow. You really can’t move forward unless you forgive yourself and the situation. Also, trust your intuition lol. In some ways, I am thankful for that relationship because it held a mirror in front of me to really see who I am, my worth, and what I deserve. They say, ‘When the pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure’ &#8211; and so it is! I’m so excited for what the future has in store for me. I’ve so much love to give and to spread. With that said, even the moments you feel like you’ve lost it all can pave a way for you to discover more about yourself and make you stronger; just trust the process.</em>”</p>

<p>Kamara – “<em>There are too many. I think there are a lot of things I did that apply to this, all of which seemed like such a big thing at the time, but now looking back, it’s actually not that deep lol. It’s inevitable for us to make mistakes and regret them like hell later on but we learn from them. I used to dwell and overthink about so many things in the past that I felt were impossible to overcome. It’s different now. No doubt it’s still a challenge, since failure doesn’t particularly feel like a learning opportunity hah. But yeah I don’t know, aren’t ‘mistakes’ just experiences? You get me?</em>”</p>

<p>Phil – “<em>I’ve had many fights, almost all of them physical; arguments with exes, squaring up with my brothers, and even some friends just to name a few. But honestly, if I look at this question and ask what fight I have struggled with the most, and one that still affects me to this day and probably will continue to till the end of my days, I would have to say the fight I’ve had with depression. It sounds cliché as fuck, I know, but that shit gets to you. It’s like you’re in a maze with the exact route of how to escape, but the closer you get to the exit, the more blind you become, and you somehow end up at the start again and it’s just a cycle of that constantly. Yeah. If that makes sense haha. That’s my biggest fight. Pizza helps though.</em>”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university year is fast drawing to a close and for many final year students, this can be a daunting time. From the nerves about impending exams and coursework, to the downright fear of stepping into the world of unemployment sans student loans; graduate life can appear impossible to navigate. However, SUBCULTURED spoke to an Oxford graduate working in fashion production and casting in London having worked as the Production Director at Wonderland Magazine, Gay Times and Man About Town Magazine. We asked about her first year going it alone and how you can make it after graduation too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussing her initial interest in fashion, she said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of my first year at Oxford, I decided to apply to an editorial role at the student paper- I wanted to be the Arts Editor. They didn’t give it to me, but they offered me the fashion editor role and told me that if I did it for a term, I might have a better chance of getting the Arts Editor role the term after. I was outraged at first; I didn’t know anything about fashion and because of all of the conventional stereotypes I assumed  it was all a bit superficial. But with a bit of thought, I realised that I had actually always loved conceptual shoots in magazines like Hunger, i-D and Dazed, and that fashion and art weren’t actually worlds apart. So I started working on the shoots for the student paper and after a few weeks, realised that despite the fact that I didn’t know anything about the industry, I had a good sense of aesthetics and had a bit of a knack for art direction. Afterwards, I founded my own fashion, arts and identity politics magazine called PAN. My team and I wanted to create a magazine that really pushed for diversity and intersectionality, covering a wide range of social issues.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the extra-curricular activities, for some graduates university may have just made them realise they don&#8217;t click with the subject they chose. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how important are specific degree subjects for getting a job in the fashion industry? She studied History of Art, and replied </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that the really high levels of pressure at Oxford, particularly whilst juggling a silly amount of extra-curricular projects helped me cope with the intense  pressures of being a Production Director so soon after uni. It definitely helped me hit the ground running.” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, perhaps it’s less about your subject, and more to do with the work ethic you have?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“History of Art as a subject is really broad and so elements of it have of course helped me since. We did a lot of reading on post-colonialism and gender and the constructs of sexuality- all things that have helped me see existing social inequality and perhaps think about how our work in fashion can help deconstruct embedded prejudices and ease existing divides. I’m not sure that History of Art specifically helped me get into fashion; it definitely came down to the extra-curricular I was involved in. I’m really glad that in my second year I realised that a degree from Oxford wouldn’t be enough to get me a job in fashion and so threw all of my energy into getting as much intern experience as possible.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And her best advice for students graduating this year, looking to get into the industry? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike a lot of industries, it’s a lot less common to apply to graduate schemes in fashion and it’s unlikely that you’ll get very far applying to jobs without any experience in the industry already. If you don’t know anyone in the industry who can help you get an internship then it’s definitely not the end of the world- which is contrary to what everyone told me when I first started. My advice would be to email people directly- if you can find one person’s email from the team then you basically know everyone’s email from the team, all you have to do is switch the names around. Go on Models.com and look through the names and the portfolios of the people in the industry who are achieving what you want to achieve. Then: google them, find them on LinkedIn and if that doesn’t find you their email address then use Instagram as a last resort. Pop them a short introductory message and ask for their email address and you can continue on there. Don’t be afraid to ask people for internships or work experience. Actually most of my interviews and small jobs have come through messaging on Instagram- people are a lot less likely to ignore you that way because I guess you feel more like a real person.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And some advice on making your social media profile a hireable one</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Make sure your Instagram looks good and that you put your work on there- people look at that and they’ll have formed an opinion of you within a minute or two. It’s unlikely that you’ll get anything paid at the start, but it isn’t impossible to manage this either- despite what people say. You’d be surprised at the amount of  of successful people in the industry who didn’t have financial support from the parents and who have fought really hard for what they now have; and if it meant working 9 hours a day interning and then 5 hours in the evening behind a bar six days a week, then so be it.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what about when you actually land a job in the industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that all magazines are slightly different when you intern there and interns often don’t have an entirely positive experience, though it’s by no means always  as bad as people say. You should always give a hundred and ten percent to everything because even if it seems like no one is paying attention to you, people do notice a good intern. If you do well at your job and people like you, you can get yourself a paid position pretty quickly- even as quickly as two or three months; because the industry has such a high turnover, they’re always looking for new people- you just have to prove yourself. A lot of internships are unpaid in fashion and that’s also something you should be prepared for if fashion is what you want to do. It can be difficult but I would always remind myself that it was going to pay-off in the long term.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get a good job in the fashion industry, London is the best place to start interning and getting experience. We asked her how she finds living in such a notoriously expensive city, and why she thinks it’s totally worth it: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“London is such a fantastic city- you can really find the people you vibe with, explore a dozen  different nightlife scenes and every week come across a new bubble in the city that you didn’t know about. I grew up in a small village on the northern border of England and Wales, and so I think that the opportunities available to me in London still fill me with so much excitement. If you’re someone like me who is super-fast-paced, wants a wide range of life-experiences,  and to meet lots of diverse characters, perspectives and cultures, then London is a big playground. It has such a great energy.”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, living in London can be a nightmare financially. London is one of the most expensive cities in the world and what would be seen as a decent wage back up North, in London is often barely enough. I have struggled financially, like everyone else- but I think that at the end of the day, your drive and passion for what you are doing keeps you afloat. If you want to make something work, it’s going to work. If it means doing stupid hours, tutoring online, buying and selling clothes on eBay for a profit, or even taking six months out to work behind a bar and save money for rent. I’m not willing to let my lack of financial-means disrupt my career in the long run, so i’ve really gone to all extents to make it work- it’s been tough, but i’ve managed it.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">if financial support is an issue for you when you graduate, there’s always the possibility of finding alternative routes to your dream job too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of expensive living costs and the struggle to get where we want to be, she discussed some of the lower points in her career so far: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fashion is not an easy industry. Nothing is going to fall into your lap- if you don’t go out of your way to email people (repeatedly), call places up, chase contacts etc. then it’ll feel like it’s an impenetrable world. But the more people you meet and the more you go out of your way to show people that you’re keen and willing to learn, the more things will work out for you. The two important things to remember  about the fashion industry are this: firstly, you’ve got to want it more than anything. Secondly, you can’t give up.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, what seems to ring true in everything she says is the importance of determination and doing everything you can to achieve your goals, because when it starts to pay off, it’ll be more than worth it. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often, the highlights for me have been some of the sets that have just fallen into place effortlessly. It’s so nice when you have an entire team that vibe really well together and everyone has fun on set. It’s often reflected in the quality of the images too.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about where she’d like her career to go from here, she said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Funnily enough, I entered the fashion industry with the intention of moving into film as soon as I had a decent amount of production experience under my belt. Recently I decided that now is the time to transfer to the  film industry and start working as a freelance Producer. A lot of the skills I gained as Production Director at Wonderland Magazine are pretty transferable to film. The experience I gained with fashion of hammering down people’s doors to get where I want is invaluable but people are a lot more responsive in film. I guess what that shows really is that fashion is the worst industry when it comes to email replies/successful job applications and that if you don’t get a positive response straight away, it’s not at all a reflection of you. You just have to keep going!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, our interviewee gave her 3 top tips on how to survive life after graduation, and getting into the industry you want:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are probably people who have a better CV than you and have more relevant experience. Don’t let that deter you- let it motivate you! Learn how to make yourself stand out more than them. </span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always be friendly, nice and down-to-earth with everyone you work with. People will remember you for that and it’s so important not to let a job title change the way you treat people whose position is below yours. In fashion, you can lose your position at any point, tables turn all the time. Don’t be a dick- it won’t work out for you. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never turn down an opportunity to gain experience, no matter how small. The absolute key to success is to be an opportunist. </span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">When Yale student Akintunde Ahmad asked Vivian Dang to photograph him and his friends, he intended to showcase the bond of their community. The photos were uploaded to Twitter with the caption: ‘Introducing the # BlackMenOfYaleUniversity’ and soon became a viral sensation.</p>
<p>The message crossed the Atlantic and struck a cord with black students in the University of Cambridge, who posed in similar fashion to show black students in the UK that there is a place for them in Cambridge and they should fight to claim it.</p>
<p>We did not hesitate for a minute to join the ranks and examine the experience of the black community in a range of British universities. From Imperial to Queen Mary to Surrey, we invited students from diverse backgrounds to share their opinions on their university experience, dispel the stereotypes that haunt their high-ranking institutions and discuss how we can move on to ensure there are more black students in higher education, how we can defeat casual racism, what we can do for the future of black students beyond higher education and much more.</p>
<p>So meet the team and stay tuned for more in our <strong><a href="https://issuu.com/subculturedmag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upcoming issue</a></strong>!</p>

<p>Anyone who stumbles across the Dear Deer page while scrolling through ASOS is in for a surprise. Far from the casual clothing that most students look for, the Dear Deer brand makes a big splash with bold prints, modern fabrics and lots of attitude.</p>
<p>The brand came together when founding members/designers/brains-behind-everything Gokhan, Zeyn and Andrey found each other and realised that they can turn their talent into a real-life occupation. As they declare in their ASOS description: &#8220;Everyone has different talents and we combined those and brought them into life with Dear Deer. We brought street fashion into our lives and worked very hard to present beautiful, flawless products.&#8221; With an emphasis on hand-drawn and hand-made designs, Dear Deer hopes that their clothes will bring good luck to whoever wears them.</p>
<p>Although the products are distinguished as male and female in terms of size, they have the same pattern and style. The intricate, vivid streetwear ascribes to genderless fashion and bares an undeniable air of cool; with a quick glance at the ASOS website, you can see the same jumper worn by a girl and a guy, but, whether paired with a leather miniskirt or a pair of trousers, the design remains unique and eye-catching. It’s the kind of clothes that you can wear casually anywhere and you are always going to get the ‘Where is <em>this</em> from?’ question.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect of the brand is its original name. According to the founders: &#8220;We wanted to reflect this genderless fashion in our logo and we gave our beloved Deer our own soul, brought it to life and made it one of us.&#8221; It is no wonder that the deer became the symbol of the brand, as the designers are inspired a lot by nature and alternative urban aesthetics. Other sources of inspiration include cinema, art, painting, drawing, sculpture and history; their success lies in being able to combine their individual interests and create something wearable, yet different from anything else we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>As for your summer wardrobe, worry not – we got you covered! Dear Deer is working on a beachwear collection with different patterns, vivid colours and new characters that is guaranteed to make heads turn your way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before going out with your friends for a night at Rubix, beware&#8230; We&#8217;ve piled up some people you might want to avoid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rugby Boys</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rugby boys listen up, no matter how much irony is intended in sentences you utter with the words “banter”, “chunder” and “bevs” – it will <strong>never</strong> be ironic coming from you. Yes ladies, if you thought the sheer immaturity of boys ended at sixth form the ‘rugby boiz’ here are insidious proofs that it is never ending. They somehow deteriorate the “men in suits” trend with their weekly show in shirts, and trousers (although, props to keeping some tradition intact in our university life). They are here to provide a service if you are in the market for a one night stand, or want to hear near death anecdotes over their dirty pints.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not much I can say, except you were cool in 2000 something then again in 2012 when scandals surrounding your lad culture hit. It’s done, we’re over it. Moving on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Inseparable Flat</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They will be bundled together on the sticky Rubix dancefloor somewhere dancing together, bursting with enough love triangles, bitter rivalries and awkward incestuous flat situations – enough to make any reality show producer wet. Made In Chelsea? No mate, I closely follow their flat stories and how x slept with y, but x goes out with his home girlfriend who came to visit and got hit on by z who also slept with y or how x’s milk is always being taken by z so x is being intentionally noisy to piss off z. Despite all this, they love each other, and then get drunk at Rubix and a foreseeable beef occurs with harsh exchanges and teary flatmates walking off or dancing with on a flatmate they should not be dancing on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please never end.</p>
<p><strong>Weird Themed Bar Crawl</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever kept finding that one person on the dancefloor dressed as a tennis player, or a cowboy then another at the bar then three in the toilet and you start to sense a pattern emerging? Yes, there’s been a themed bar crawl pre-Rubix by some society. They will be together throughout the <strong>whole entire </strong>bar path, but somehow will distribute and immerse themselves as they get to Rubix. This leaves the rest of us Rubix-ers confused and tasked with finding out what the actual theme was.</p>
<p><strong>Edgy Kidz in the Smoking Area</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They sit camped in the smoking area engulfed in Urban Outfitters garms and thrift store vintage Adidas sulking over when the next Presha is. Will do go inside? Absolutely can’t make them, because even remotely enjoying any other music than the bass-y tunes deeply embedded somewhere in Soundcloud will hurt their wavey soul. If you ask them where they are from, you are expecting “South London” or “Islington” because of their attire, but they will probably reply with a location that ends in ‘shire’ or is suburban. Now, some of their parents make enough money for them to afford straight cigarettes, but obviously smoking rollies deems some sort of an edge. I hate to break this to you, however, you show as much edge as a regular circle.</p>
<p><strong>Just Your Average International Students Who Are Secret Millionaires</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They vape, have immaculate “fresh” trims and they don’t have to take out a second loan to afford double shot drinks at Rubix – that is all you need to know about them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, also walk around campus in Adidas slippers with socks and skinny trackies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overly Dressed Girls</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They are going to see a DJ who’s playlist is predominately based on his Twitter request, yet they are dressed like they are about to be photographed by an army of paparazzi as you enter The Oscars (#prayforLeo #yayforLeo). The girls that are dressed as page 2 of the dress (or bralet) section of Missguided.com; this one is for you. Soldering on in heels and fake lashes till 12am, but beyond that we witness Bambi walking after birth as they are too intoxicated to function.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is that a squeal I hear on the dancefloor? Did DJ Leroy put on your song??!??!1? Did DJ Leroy put that on that Disney song you “ironically” pre’d to with your girls and now it’s on and you’re singing along?!??!1?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Predators</strong><br />
They are located, and often entirely takeover and block, the passageway of the stairs just above Hari’s bar – where you can see the dancefloor with the booths. They are there skanking, and lurking.</p>
<p><strong>Photo Hoggers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For whatever reason; want to document their douchebag animal onesie, a bunch of ladsladslads wearing a dress, pose and do a dab or want to photograph their flat together or want to photobomb, these people are on a relentless mission to get a photograph from the club photographers. Is it an achievement to be on the student union Facebook page?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My question to you; y doe?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>When did you first develop an interest in fashion photography?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be honest, it wasn’t until I was unexpectedly catapulted into the midst of SS15 backstage madness that my interest in fashion photography found its footing. Before that, my photographic endeavours were people-orientated, but ranged from documenting local band nights to experimenting with self portraits; and occasionally I would muster up the courage to ask friends and acquaintances to model for me. However, perhaps it was somewhat inevitable that my photographs would become fashionably inclined, as I am intrigued and keen to experiment with the way in which clothes can be used to express different personas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How did your interest progress from being a hobby to having work published online?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To quote a friend who suddenly found himself walking for Moschino: serendipitous circumstances. I was in London for few days during fashion week SS15 trying my hand at shooting street style &#8211; because where better to have such a collective of willing subjects to practise on! By chance I got chatting to a backstage photographer who allowed me to assist him for a couple of shows. I managed to grab a few shots of my own, and later sent them to a few magazines asking if they required a photographer for next season. V magazine replied within a few hours, and the whirlwind of new experiences, new friendships, and lots of hastened trial-and-error learning progressed from there!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Natural Sciences degree is quite different to fashion photography; what made you choose an academic degree over a creative one?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have always been interested in the sciences: in particular, trying to understand the processes that enable our bodies to function and interact with the environment around us. To me, it was only natural that I would pursue an academic degree in order to broaden my scientific knowledge, and to keep my interest in photography and the arts as a creative outlet to escape to from my more academic studies. I also don’t like being told what to do, creatively speaking. I like to work when the mood or the inspiration strikes. I’m scared that I’d end up hating photography if I was doing it non-stop.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How do you balance your academic degree with your fashion photography pursuits (photographing shows, editing, Instagram-ing, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Balancing the two contrasting parts of my life requires a fair bit of organisation and good time management. I’m lucky to have tutors at university who are genuinely interested in my photography work and are keen for me to continue to pursue it &#8211; but at the same time, I’ve had to show that I’m equally hardworking towards my degree. Sometimes that means foregoing nights out in order to get assignments finished or just to catch up on sleep, and I hit the library at any spare moment I have during the day so I can be as productive with my time as possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tips for breaking into fashion photography?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a great believer in that you make your own luck. Breaking into the creative industry notoriously requires an element of good fortune, but equally it requires making the most of the opportunities that arise. Be friendly, speak to people, be interested in what they do, assist other photographers, do favours, work hard, be prepared to work unconventional hours, utilise social media to your advantage &#8211; Instagram is a powerful thing!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What do you hope to do after you graduate?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dreaded question! I know that I want to pursue a career in the sciences &#8211; I am particularly interested in the science of food and allergies &#8211; and to be able to continue with freelance photography work alongside. However, the last twelve months have taught me that life can be incredibly unpredictable. So for now, I am mostly living for the moment, working hard and acting on each and every opportunity as it comes.</p>
