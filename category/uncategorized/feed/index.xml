										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>Dating in the modern age is tough for everyone &#8211; but
especially so for members of the LGBTQ+ community. It is bad enough to have to
fight stereotypes and discrimination outside the community, but many find that
the dating scene for queer people is just as littered with prejudice from
within. </p>



<p>Richard (not his real name) is a gay man (he/him pronouns)
living in East London:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;You would expect
a lot of LGBTQ+ people to be really chill and accepting, but I think many
people still discriminate, and just excuse it by saying it is “just a
preference&#8221;. But seeing people put on their profiles: &#8220;no
blacks&#8221;, &#8220;no femmes&#8221; or &#8220;no Asians&#8221; time and time
again, it is just ostracising. There are so many different &#8220;tribes&#8221;
and labels, and there is so much pressure to fit in. </em></p>



<p><em>Just because of my
skin colour,</em></p>



<p><em>or because I&#8217;m too
feminine</em></p>



<p><em>or not skinny enough…</em></p>



<p><em>you&#8217;re completely
disregarded.”</em></p>



<p>Everything seems to be based on the physical! People who
have the most success on gay dating apps like Grindr are usually donning
headless torsos for profile pictures and some sort of gay-emoji-hybrid language
that usually translates to: <em>drumroll
please</em>…</p>



<p>Sex.</p>



<p>Just looking for the quick fix! One-night stand! It all revolves
around sex – it perpetuates the stereotype both within and outside the gay
community that we are promiscuous, and sex obsessed. Tinder is not that much
better. It is still very superficial, so it becomes hard to make any real,
meaningful connections. </p>



<p>Cherry, a trans woman (she/her pronouns) from West Sussex,
has been in an online relationship now for 7 months. But it has not always been
easy:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I think the Internet and dating apps can be vital for a lot of queer people to find one another. Growing up in a small village, I always felt isolated. Online I felt like I could make so many friends and meet people just like me. But as a trans woman, I get so much harassment on dating apps and just online in general.</em><br><em>People either fetishize you, ask you inappropriate questions or hurl transphobic abuse at you.</em><br><em>I&#8217;ve even been told to kill myself. I&#8217;m kind of numb to it now, but it&#8217;s still pretty awful out here for a lot of trans men and women.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Many people who are disillusioned with the more popular
dating apps are now looking elsewhere to find that special someone. This year
saw progress for queer online dating: the release of apps such as Taimi,
dedicated to all members of the LGBTQ+ community, offer those who may be tired
of Tinder or who get grumpy over Grindr an alternative. But with so many apps
out there to choose from, the dating app market has become saturated &#8211; and with
no guarantee of any matches, a lot of LGBTQ+ people can be left feeling rather
lonely. </p>



<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom – sure, as a community we
have just a few more hurdles to jump over than if you are a cishet (cishetero-
straight and not trans), and this article is by no means exhaustive. Every
member of the LGBTQ+ community will face very different and very real
challenges. It isn’t the responsibility of straight people to pair us up – so no
Karen, just because you have one gay friend and we both like Mean Girls doesn’t
mean you’re a professional matchmaker.</p>



<p>My advice to any queer singleton would be this: it will happen. From someone who spent too much time on dating apps tapping, swiping and super liking for ‘Mr Right’, just spend that time focusing on being happy with yourself. Someone will come along one day who will fall head over heels for you as you are in your entirety, so don’t drive yourself crazy looking for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>As
Christmas approaches and the festive spirit has made you go up and down the
high street multiple times, in desperate search for that special gift, you
might even end up in a bookshop, browsing for a festive read to consume by the
family fireplace or attempting to find something for those rare few that
actually like reading books or just looking for somewhere to sit down to give
your tired joints a rest from carrying too many bags. </p>



<p>Whatever
the reason that made you end up in a bookshop, worry not. There are
instructions to help you navigate such a dangerous environment. As a seasonal
bookseller and a former (very annoying) customer, I am clearly in an excellent
position to force my recommendations down your throat. If you are not so burned
out from university that the idea of books makes you feel sick, read on for
some of the top picks that have captured my heart. &nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Normal
People </em>by Sally
Rooney </p>



<p>Former
Waterstones Book of the Year remains one of my all-time favourite finds. If you
have missed out on the Sally Rooney phenomenon, get ready because this book
will blow up all over again in the new year, as a 12-part series based on it is
landing on BBC Three at some point in 2020. In this novel, Rooney chronicles
the relationship between Marianne and Connell, two characters who met as
teenagers in a small town in the west of Ireland and whose paths keep crossing
as they go about their lives. Both Marianne and Connell are characters that
sweep you up and take you on a journey as they come to terms with the things
happening in their lives, while Rooney’s unique style catches the reader’s
attention from the first page. When I first picked up the book, the characters
seemed to be coming straight out of the page, in a way that reminded me exactly
of what Rooney had been compared to: Salinger. This warmth and immediacy, the
way the story simply flows through the pages, makes this a compulsive read and
one of those books that you can give to anyone in your life who simply wants to
get lost in a ‘millenial’(here used as synonym for fresh and modern) love
story. </p>



<p><em>My
Sister, The Serial Killer</em>
by Oyinkan Braithwaite</p>



<p>Next
up on books that you will not be able to put down comes Braithwaite, whose
story deals with a pesky little problem: that of your sister being an actual
serial killer. Of men. Specifically, of men that are her boyfriends. All you
need to do to get hooked is to read through the first page, where Korede
describes matter-of-factly the complications of scrubbing off blood and
proceeds to give us a full description of what she usually does to cover up for
her sister. The relationship between the sisters is front and centre, against
the backdrop of Ayoola’s absurd little habit, and the spanner in the murderous
works (okay, maybe their relationship should have been put to the test ages
ago, maybe when Ayoola first killed someone, but hey, the things we do for
family) comes in the form of a cute doctor. Korede harbours feelings for said doctor,
but it is Ayoola who befriends him, leading to a lot of nail-biting questions: is
he going to end up as another of Ayoola’s victims or is Korede going to let go
of her loyalty to her sister to save him?</p>



<p><em>Find
Me </em>by André Aciman</p>



<p>This
is the sequel to <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>. Need I say more?</p>



<p>OK,
I will. If you watched the movie and you liked it, then pick up the first book.
And then, pick up the sequel. This book is a return to Italy, Elio, Oliver, and
love, love, love. For those doubting whether there is a point in a sequel, I
hear you. Arguably, the story itself does not need more: those who have read
the first book are very aware of how things unfolded. Those who watched the
movie probably walked out with exactly what they needed to take away from it:
the roller-coaster ride of Elio’s first love. But <em>Find Me </em>is a sequel
that only Aciman could write – as in, it’s not. It’s just a chance to spend
some more time with the characters, the way you would drop in on an old
acquaintance to find out what is going on with them. The characters we loved
during that brief, explosive summer are now in different stages of their lives.
Samuel, Elio’s father, is navigating old age and his relationship with his son;
things are set in a new light when he meets someone on the train to Rome. Elio,
now a pianist in his thirties, is more than happy to take us on a walk around
Rome, as he finds himself mesmerised by a stranger. Oliver, working as a
professor in New York, befriends two people that remind him of what he had to
let go of. Aciman is at his best when writing Elio, but the snapshot of Oliver
is also enjoyable. We don’t see him just through Elio’s eyes, as we did in the
first book; we get to explore him separately. For those who want to soak up
some more of that feeling, of love at its most intense, <em>Find Me</em> will
give you exactly that. </p>



<p><em>Three
Women </em>by Lisa
Taddeo </p>



<p>Turning
to non-fiction, Taddeo’s debut is absolutely brilliant. It is an account of
three women, whose lives Taddeo examines with forensic detail. She spent eight
years with these women, piecing together their stories, talking to them, and
experiencing herself many of the moments she writes about. This is a book that
lays bare female desire, how it shapes women’s lives, how they chase it and are
broken by it, by men, by other women. Each woman has her own narrative: Maggie
is a teenage girl who falls in love with her teacher, Lina is a wife and
mother, whose marriage has started to taste sour as desire is completely gone,
and Sloane is the beautiful, well-off, all-too-perfect woman, whose sexual
relationship with her husband and other men walks the line between sexual
freedom and objectification. Messy and engrossing, these women come alive by
Taddeo’s bold writing. Throughout the book, Maggie’s story does not fail to
captivate us, because we have heard it too many times: the lonely girl and the
innocent crush on the perfect teacher, who is kind and understanding… But then
the crush turns into a court case, which turns Maggie into ‘a whore’ and ‘a
liar.’ Maggie’s story is very much a story of our time.&nbsp; </p>



<p>And
finally…</p>



<p><em>Girl,
Woman, Other</em> by
Bernardine Evaristo </p>



<p>I would not be able to get back to my Christmas bookselling without trying to entice you to buy one of the most known titles that came out in 2019. Evaristo is not ‘another author’ (as she was recently referred to by the BBC – the other author that shared the Booker, ehm, the one that’s not Margaret Atwood), but the first black female winner of the Booker Prize (yay, we finally got there). Through her award-winning prose, Evaristo looks at black womanhood in modern Britain by presenting portraits of different women, whose lives are interconnected, but whose experiences are very different. Amma kicks things off – her struggle to be true to her political beliefs, to be a feminist, to be a voice for the community, to get a foot through the door as a playwright, to raise her daughter right, to navigate her affairs with women… she immediately makes us question everything. Her daughter, Yazz, reflects on her mother and her experience of growing up in an unconventional household, her life at university, her feminist and political beliefs, her ideas about privilege. And the stories go on, interrogating every aspect of life and delving into the very questions we have started to ask today, written in an experimental and original style.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Christmas break is nearly upon us. Yes, you’ve probably got
bags under your eyes and a dwindling bank account. But make sure you put some
money aside to celebrate the festive period – you’ve earned it. This is a mash
up of merry motives in and around Surrey, so you can do exactly that. </p>



<p><strong>Santa Fir Christmas
Tree Farm and Shop </strong></p>



<p>If you aren’t feeling that Christmassy vibe yet, Santa Fir
Christmas Tree Farm and Shop is the place to start. Based in Guildford, and
open seven days a week, this little gem has all the essentials you need to
transform you and your home into something at least a little more Santa’s
grotto. The farm has a huge selection of trees to choose from, as well as a Christmas
shop to explore. What’s more, on December 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>,
you can catch the local produce market, offering top quality local foods and
drinks. Pick from Surrey Hills Wood Fired Pizza, Wessex Gin Distillery, Firebird
Brewery and even Waffle on a Stick. Because eating waffles on a plate is so
2018, right? </p>



<p><strong>A Christmas Carol at
the Old Vic </strong></p>



<p>It’s sometimes easy to forget that Guildford is right on London’s doorstep. Hop on a train to the capital and snap up tickets for <em>A Christmas Carol </em>at the Old Vic<em>. </em>Just a short walk from Waterloo, this one is well worth the money. Once inside you can expect an excellent performance topped off with free mince pies and mulled wine. And for those of you that are fans of Peep Show, you’ll be glad to see Alan Johnson (Patterson Joseph) playing a leading role as Scrooge. What’s not to love?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>via oldvictheatre.com</em></p>



<p><strong>Backyard Cinema’s Winter
Night Garden</strong></p>



<p>One not to be missed for the film buffs out there. Situated
in Wandsworth, London, Backyard is much more than your average independent
cinema. The Winter Night Garden themed venue hosts a range of Christmas
classics including Elf, Home Alone, The Holiday and Miracle on 34<sup>th</sup>
Street. What sets this cinema apart is its truly immersive atmosphere and the
‘enchanted forest’ which surrounds your viewing experience – definitely one for
the gram. Be sure to book tickets ASAP, as many screenings are already fully
booked. </p>



<p><strong>The Ivy Chelsea </strong></p>



<p>Ideal for those of you that have (somehow) managed to sustain a healthy bank balance, or perhaps those with a stretchy overdraft. The Ivy, in Chelsea, might just be the best December destination for food and drinks in London. This year, the restaurant’s seasonal theme is the Christmas classic Narnia and it doesn’t disappoint. Shrouded in snow-covered forest decorations, cocktails garnished with Turkish delight and complete with a wardrobe instead of a front door…(obviously ?!). So if you’ve got a pound or two to spare, make sure The Ivy is on your list.</p>

<p><strong>The George Tavern
Christmas Cockney sing along </strong></p>



<p>In search of Christmas cheer without the price tag then The
George Tavern, in London may be just what you’re looking for. There is
something wonderfully classic about The George. The place is candle-lit, the
staff are super friendly, the drinks are reasonable, and it was also the former
local of the likes of Pete Doherty and Kate Moss. </p>



<p>This Sunday, the pub is hosts its much-loved Cockney
Singalong, with a Christmas twist. The singalongs are locally famous, and if
you go, you’ll soon see why. There is a great variety of performers, each
highly talented and classically dressed. So If you’re up for a nostalgic
singalong in a charming vintage pub, The George has to be on your list. </p>



<p><strong>Somerset House
Gingerbread City and Ice Rink</strong></p>



<p>This December, Somerset House is home to the Museum of Architecture’s hugely popular Gingerbread City Exhibition. You can book a ticket today for just £9, and once you’ve explored the edible city, why not skate on one of the most iconic ice rinks in the city, featuring a 40ft tall Christmas tree. The good news is adult tickets are only £11, not bad for a truly memorable Christmas experience.</p>

<p><strong>And finally in need of some seasonal revelry ?</strong></p>



<p>This list wouldn’t be complete without a round-up of the Christmas club nights taking place in Guildford. With a range of options you’re certain to find a night out you and the gang agree with. On Friday 13<sup>th</sup>, Bar Thirteen is hosting ‘Santa’s Twerk Shop’. The following day is Thirty3hz’s ‘Christmas House Party’, and on Monday 16<sup>th</sup> Popworld stages the ‘Christmas Cracker’. And on campus this Thursday, don’t miss the Funk Soul Disco Winter Boogieland, featuring Saint Nic himself. Who knew he is the father of Christmas <em>and</em> funk? It’s going to be a spectacle, that’s for sure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>Should you find yourself uninspired this winter, Fashion
Weeks worldwide observed a highly eclectic mix of trends, with something for
everyone. From the suited, sophisticated female boss to the streetwear-loving risk
taker, there was a place for all tastes in high-fashion this season. The
catwalks even saw the intertwining of the traditionally hyper-feminine and ultra-masculine.
This included bows and exaggerated jewellery paired with Saville Row style
suiting. </p>



<h5>Well-Suited </h5>



<p>With blazers having been a prominent garment in the fashion
world over the past year, Fashion Week saw this trend taken to the next level.
Full body tailoring in a number of silhouettes featured across designers,
including Gucci and Fendi are often in reference to the 70’s. Suits are
considered a staple and are a highly worthwhile investment for anybody wanting
to dip their toes into the world of haute couture. Constantly wearable &#8211; especially
for students transitioning into the working world &#8211; suits are a timeless look
and there are great styles available for every price range. Zara, in
particular, as well as ASOS and Topshop feature a number of great options.</p>

<h5>Check Mate </h5>



<p>Alongside the popularity of suits this autumn are also the
inclusions of check, tweed, and houndstooth patterns. This was especially notable
in Chanel, Gucci and Dolce and Gabbana runway shows. This trend can be worn in
a multitude of ways, from a full coordinate set or a trailing overcoat, to an
understated headband or beret. </p>

<h5>Collegiate Fashion </h5>



<p>Also known as ‘preppy’ fashion as inspired by preparatory
schools; collegiate fashion is seeing a rebirth. This look is categorised by
highly feminine pleated skirts, turtlenecks, blouses (particularly of the
pussy-bow variety), knee length boots, headbands, and scarves, and intense
layering.&nbsp; The runways of Celine,
Burberry, and Dior have exemplified this. River Island has a number of options for
collegiate autumn looks, including an amazing selection of blouses. </p>

<h5>Dark Romance</h5>



<p>Florals in spring may not be ground-breaking, but florals in
winter just might be. This season sees the arrival of Renaissance inspired dark
floral looks, and sensual black lace details. Prada has been a particular
proprietor of this look, as has Givenchy for a number of years. This romantic
and sensual look can be extremely chic and transferable to the collegiate look
with the right blouse. One might look for a cinched waist and billowy sleeves,
which is highly effective when coupled with leather on the bottom half.
Additionally, a dark-patterned midi or maxi skirt and sweater can be equally fashionable.
</p>

<h5>Baroque and Roll </h5>



<p>This is the season to bring out grandma’s old jewellery.
Gold toned antique inspired accessories are all the rage at the moment,
particularly including pendant necklaces and pearl detailing. Chanel Fine
Jewellery and Bulgari are examples of this, however vintage pieces are perfect
for this look, and looking to second hand stores ensures uniqueness.
Alternatively, Zara has a number of options available paying homage to this
style. </p>

<h5>Blocked </h5>



<p>Living on from last winter, colour blocking this year
includes a lot of pink.&nbsp; With stand out
looks coming from Chanel, Balenciaga and Max Mara, this seems an excellent way
to brighten up the gloomiest of winters. This can be done easily with a
coordinate or a suit, however the simple inclusion of a pink piece can be just
as fashionable. Otherwise, mismatching block coloured pieces is a bolder way to
wear the look.&nbsp; </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-attachment-id="3893" data-permalink="/need-to-know-fashion-trends-for-winter/mb6/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MB6.png?fit=702%2C614&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="702,614" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="MB6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MB6.png?fit=300%2C262&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MB6.png?fit=702%2C614&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="702" height="614" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MB6.png?resize=702%2C614" alt="Description: Colour%20Blocking.png" class="wp-image-3893" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MB6.png?w=702&amp;ssl=1 702w, https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MB6.png?resize=300%2C262&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<h5>Waist a Minute&nbsp; </h5>



<p>Belted blazers, belted coats, belted everything. Accentuation of the traditional feminine form works to compliment the masculine shapes growing increasingly popular. A waist belt also helps tie together layered ensembles, cinching in the midsection and making an outfit universally flattering when placed over the outer layer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>As I batter through the torrential rain along the
South Bank, making my way to the Tate Modern, I spot Marouane in the entrance, detectable
by his art-school chic look. He greets me with two kisses and immediately starts
berating the English weather, as you would expect from someone who has spent
the best part of their life in sun-soaked Barcelona.</p>



<p>The photographer has recently moved to London in search of greater opportunities, like many budding creatives. Alongside his photographic ventures, he balances long hours as a waiter at a Mexican restaurant. He became interested in photography at the age of 16, and now, in his mid-twenties, he has gained just under 3,000 Instagram followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fotoraval/?hl=en">@fotoraval</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jesuismarwan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@jesuismarwan (opens in a new tab)">@jesuismarwan</a>, and been shortlisted for <em>La Cruz Roja</em> annual photo competition. His works focuses on capturing the transient moments of childhood, integration, immigration and multiculturalism, creating an anthropological documentation of the cities, towns and neighborhoods he frequents.</p>



<p><strong>Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and your childhood?</strong><br><em>I was born in the capital of Morocco, Rabat, in 1993. After nine years, I moved to Barcelona with my family, so that I could go to school in Spain; we were living in the northern bohemian barrio of Gracía. When I was fifteen, we moved to Hospitalet, the built-up industrial city that fringes Barcelona, an area popular with migrants. When I went to university, I studied History in Raval. However, I quickly realised that I did not like my course, so I moved to study photography in Exiample in 2014, at the Institute of Photography. After my studies, I moved to live by myself in El Raval. </em></p>



<p><strong>When did you start taking photos?</strong><br><em>Well, firstly at home, in the home. I received a camera from my father for a birthday when I was fifteen or sixteen. I remember I started taking photos without any intention, I was just taking pictures of my mother, my father. In fact, I spent a lot of time at home after school with my mum, so I started taking pictures of cutlery, our interior décor, anything really, to practice with my camera. At the start, I was quite scared of taking pictures of people in the street, especially due to the fear that someone would rob me. I have actually been robbed three times in Barcelona!</em></p>



<p><strong>Really?! Me too, but Barcelona does have one of the worst reputations for theft!</strong><br><em>I know and it is not just the tourists who are affected! But then, when I started venturing into my neighborhood, it was totally different to taking pictures in the comfort of my house. To be truthful, my curiosity ignited when I took the camera to the street. You could focus on the expressions of people’s faces, so I just started taking photos of everything and anyone indiscriminately and then later went on to edit it when I returned home. <br>There was one photo which I took which I liked a lot [Below]it turned out, that the guy in the photo, he lived in the Plaza and was a local resident in El Raval. When I took this photo, didn’t realise that he was in it until I was reviewing my footage later on. What I find most striking is how he has noticed me taking photos and I hadn’t acknowledged him, despite his gaze being fixed upon me. This photo motivated and inspired me to continue my work and from then on, I choose to always work in distance and never up close.</em></p>

<p><strong>We have spoken briefly about the photos you have taken in Barcelona, however from your photography I have seen that you have travelled &nbsp;throughout Europe and Morocco. Where has been your favourite place to take photos?</strong><br><em>I mean I was actually discussing this with a few of my friends. I was in Stamford Hill, I was trying to capture a small glimpse into </em><s><em>of</em></s><em> Jewish life or culture or something, but I felt like it wasn’t the right environment. In truth, I find it hard to take pictures in London. I prefer Barcelona or Morocco, London is something a little different, a little cold. But also, less grabs my attention and peaks my curiosity, than in comparison to Spain. </em></p>



<p><strong>Wow… that is interesting. Do you think the environment impacts your motivation</strong> t<strong>o capture?</strong><br><em>Absolutely, I mean even in the neighbourhoods (in London) where you expect a little more life or culture, I have not found the same level of interest in comparison to Barcelona. I think I need to adapt my method for places where I encounter these problems. However, I also think that for example in Spain, life happens outside, on the streets. I can work in a terrace of a café or restaurant, taking pictures easily without being notice, but London has very few places that facilitates that level of anonymity.</em></p>



<p><strong>You said that you prefer to work from a distance, why is this?</strong><br><em>For me it is important not to interfere with what the subject is doing. It sounds very cliché but I like the candid manner of capturing a person in the midst of their day, without interrupting them. </em></p>



<p><strong>Can you show me the favourite photo that you have taken?</strong><br><em>(Laughing) I am so annoying about this photo but it really is my favourite.</em></p>

<p><em>I took this photo whilst having a coffee in El Raval and submitted it to the La Cruz Roja, The Red Cross street photography competition. However, I needed permission from the women in the photo. It turned out one woman was the community leader and the other was her mother. As it happened, the grandmother had no photos of herself at all, but when she was showed mine, she was really pleased with it. </em></p>



<p><em>This is my second favourite photo. I took it in Morocco. For me, with this one it is the composition, the lines, the light, everything. </em></p>

<p><strong>How easy did you find it taking photos in Morocco?</strong><br><em>Well, it is difficult. Here it’s hard, as people don’t want to be the subject. Whereas in Morocco, taking pictures is a novelty &#8211; everyone wants to come up to you and ask you what you are doing. Having said that, one time I was taking pictures and a man shouted at me “Do you think we are monkeys?” You also have to be very careful.</em></p>



<p><strong>Why do you prefer to take your photos black and white?</strong><br><em>I work in this way, primarily because it’s a traditional aesthetic technique of street photography. However, for the subjects of my work it is also much easier, as it allows you to focus on the expressions of the individuals, rather than the colours and chaos that surrounds them. There are also three varying shades of black, white and grey, which allow for a subtle diversity of tone. To the viewer it is easier to receive it. Also, it is quicker to edit.</em></p>



<p><strong>Do you have any up-coming projects?</strong><br><em>Well actually, I started this photo book project a year ago which consisted of leaving letters randomly around Barcelona and also giving to my friends who were traveling to places such as Mexico, US, Russia or India to do the same. The letters are handwritten by me and ask for a photo and an answer to a question. The idea is to create a book documenting the photos and comments that I receive from the people who find the envelopes. Since arriving in London I have left more 100 envelopes in places like the Tate Modern or the Tube, but sadly I have not yet received any responses from London, next month I plan to intensify the project.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody">London-based SHADED are the perfect blend of modern pop-punk and cool rock; SHADED have shared stages all over the UK with the likes of Mallory Knox, Coast to Coast, Catch Fire and many more. Lead vocalist, Matt East, guitarist, Callum Irons and bassist, Dan Bradberry have proven in a short space of time, and with huge talent, that the pop-punk boy band is far from dead.</p>
<p>SUBCULTURED sat down the guys and had the chance to ask them a little more about where SHADED came from, and where it’s going.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hey guys, thank you so much for taking the time to answer a few questions for SUBCULTURED! Could you start by just introducing yourself and your role in the band?</strong></p>
<p><em>Hey, no worries at all, thanks for having us!</em></p>
<p><em>So, I’m Matt. I sing in the band.</em><br />
<em>I’m Callum, I play guitar.</em><br />
<em>I’m Dan, I play bass</em></p>

<p><strong>What got you involved in music in the first place? How did you end up here as a band?</strong></p>
<p><em>Matt: So I think all our involvements in music started when we were younger. We all grew up heavily invested in music and, personally, i’ve always had this tunnel vision in which music has always been the only thing I’ve wanted to do and the only option for me.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where did the name SHADED come from, have you always been SHADED or have there been other band names? What’s the story behind it?</strong></p>
<p><em>Matt: Just like most bands, there was a few tweaks and changes at the start. SHADED actually sprung to mind when we were writing our first EP. There was no real thought, story or deep meaning behind it. It just clicked.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So you’re going on tour soon (congratulations!) where are you most excited to play and are you nervous at all? How do you deal with the anticipation of performing on stage?</strong></p>
<p><em>Matt: Birmingham always shows us a good time so we’re definitely excited for that one. London is my home city and pretty close to home for the other guys too so that show at 229 should be cool. We don’t get nervous anymore, no. I think it was the first show we played back in 2017 &#8211; that was probably the only time we’ve been REALLY nervous.</em></p>
<p><em>To be honest, I know it sounds pretty self-explanatory but the best way to deal with nerves is just to consciously go out and enjoy yourself. Don’t think about what others are going to think, what you&#8217;re going to sound like, what you look like when you perform &#8211; if you are having a good time, confidence will come… and with confidence, naturally comes a better performance!</em></p>

<p><strong>We’ve seen you talk a little bit about the meanings behind some of your songs elsewhere, but could take us through the creative process of that? Where do you start and what inspires you?</strong></p>
<p><em>Matt: So Callum and I start by laying down instrumentals for our songs. Obviously, before reaching the final stages they go through a fair few changes, but that gives us a solid base to work with.</em></p>
<p><em>Lyrically, I try to be as genuine and as black and white as I can. I don’t try to beat around the bush and be mysterious with metaphors and various figures of speech &#8211; if I want to say something, I say it. Inspiration normally comes from things I have experienced with friends, family and past relationships.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for other musicians out there who are struggling to get signed, or find opportunities to get more experience?</strong></p>
<p><em>Matt: Straight off the bat, get on the local gig circuit. Get your name out there locally to promoters and venues and put a lot of time into building up a local fanbase.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Could each of you give us a recommendation for some new music?</strong></p>
<p><em>Matt: I’m really into Pale Waves and Lewis Capaldi at the moment. Also, definitely check out Stand Atlantic if you haven&#8217;t already!</em><br />
<em>Callum: I’m really into Jordan Davis at the moment! He’s recently released a banging album.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And finally, where do you see the future of the band going? Any big things in the works we should be looking out for?</strong></p>
<p>Matt: We’ve all got big dreams and goals for this band, of which we’re slowly achieving as time goes on. We’ve got a lot in the works, nothing of which we can fully reveal yet, but you’ll know very soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many trends that become popular for all the wrong reasons, but the rising interest in cruelty-free make up is certainly a positive one. Popular YouTubers and bloggers such as Sarah Hawkinson, Monami Frost and Channon Rose have gone cruelty free and show how easily it is done. Going cruelty free does not restrict your beauty shopping purely to Lush and The Body Shop &#8211; there are actually plenty of high end options, as well as amazing budget drugstore alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most important step in finding cruelty free make up is to do your research prior to purchasing. If you ask the shop assistant at the counter whether their brand tests on animals, they will always say no, because there are plenty of loopholes. Since March 2013 it has been illegal to sell animal tested products in the EU, however it doesn&#8217;t stop these companies testing abroad. The number one question in finding cruelty free make-up is whether the brand sells their products in China, because by doing so they <a href="http://www.lovelywitches.co.uk/2015/09/china-animal-testing.html"><strong><em>automatically give consent</em></strong></a> to have their products tested on animals per local requirements. Vicky from Ethical Elephant has written a really great guide with other ways to <a href="http://elephant-room.org/how-to-tell-cosmetics-are-cruelty-free/"><strong><em>determine whether a brand is cruelty free.</em></strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS. Before we start, there is a difference between cruelty-free and vegan make-up. Cruelty-free refers to make-up not being tested on animals, which is what this post primarily focuses on.</p>

<p><strong>Urban Decay</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Urban Decay is probably most famous for their Naked eye shadow palettes, however this brand is great for your entire make-up routine as most of their products are very highly rated. I would particularly suggest trying their Naked Skin Foundation, if you like having a weightless and light layer of make up. In fact, most of Urban Decay make up products have received nothing but praise, and they are extremely popular in the beauty blogging community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though Urban Decay is owned by L&#8217;Oreal (<a href="http://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/news/loreal-animal-testing-not-cruelty-free/"><strong><em>who test on animals</em></strong></a>), most people will still support the brand for maintaining their ethical stance against animal testing. By buying more Urban Decay products, consumers are able to show L&#8217;Oreal that there is a real demand for cruelty-free products.<br />

<p><b>Jeffree Star </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Long-term internet sensation and beauty guru extraordinaire, Jeffree Star, has launched a colorful cult make-up brand that is entirely cruelty free. Many of their products are also 100% vegan. To access the full range, you need to buy them from Jeffree Star Cosmetics website, however if you want to avoid high shipping fees and possible custom taxes, I would suggest buying them from certified UK retailers. Coctail Cosmetics sells Jeffree Star cosmetics in the UK, but due to high demand, you need to check the page every few days or so. It took me about 3 weeks to finally score these two shades, but they were definitely worth it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you like Jeffree Star Cosmetics, you will also like Kat Von D, Kylie Cosmetics (good luck scoring a lip kit, though) and Gerard Cosmetics &#8211; all cruelty free brands.<img data-attachment-id="845" data-permalink="/guide-cruelty-free-make/olympus-digital-camera-22/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?fit=2500%2C1875&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2500,1875" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;E-PL7&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1459959180&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;14&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2500&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?resize=1200%2C900" alt="Cruelty-free-make-up-UK" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.subculturedmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/P4060020.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Barry M</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of nail polish, if you want the best of all worlds, Barry M is the one. Long-lasting, budget friendly and plenty to choose from &#8211; what more could you want? Their Gelly Hi Shine nail polish makes your nails look like they have been done at a salon. I&#8217;ve acquired so many Barry M nail polish bottles over the years for these reasons! Barry M is also great for other make up items, such as their Extra Volume Black Mascara and Contour Kit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They are also working closely to end animal testing in other continents. What&#8217;s even better is that Barry M clearly label their 100% vegan products with a green logo on the back, making shopping a lot easier for those who avoid animal ingredients.</p>

<p><strong>Nars</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although what initially attracted me to Nars was their sleek packaging, the product quality and their cruelty free status is what kept me a fan. Nars is probably best known for their foundations and blushers with *ehm* eye catching names such as Orgasm and Deep Throat. They also have a great matte lip range, if that&#8217;s your look!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should also be noted that Nars is owned by Shisheido. Their parent company does test on animals, but Nars does not. Similarly to Urban Decay, I choose to support Nars&#8217; initiative, and hope that it will be introduced in their parent company too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Some other cruelty free brands found in the UK</strong> (in-store and/or online) : Superdrug own brand, Charlotte Tilbury, Anastasia Beverly Hills, Marc Jacobs Beauty (not perfume), Bare Minerals, By Terry, Laura Mercier (read more<a href="http://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/news/does-laura-mercier-test-on-animals/"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>here</em></strong></a>), Hurraw, Dr Bronner, Eyeko, Lush, Illamasqua, The Body Shop, Nip + Fab, The Balm, Pixi.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RIMMEL VS CLINIQUE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are familiar with Clinique&#8217;s Chubby Sticks then you know how useful it is to essentially have a lip balm with the colour payoff of a lipstick. So if you don&#8217;t own one, then it&#8217;s time you add some of them to your makeup collection! Or you could save yourself some money and get Rimmel&#8217;s Colour Rush Balms instead. The colour payoff of the balms is great and they are very moisturising.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>THE PERFECT RED</strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">When seeking products for the perfect red lip, many gravitate towards MAC&#8217;s <em>Rubby Woo</em> or <em>Russian Red</em>. But you should give Rimmel&#8217;s Kate Matte lipstick in <em>Kiss of Life</em> a try. Very pigmented and long lasting and, even though it is a matte formula, it won&#8217;t dry out your lips. With this one great quality comes at a great price.</p>
